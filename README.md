# CS 182 Project: PINN

Here is a demonstration of the key ideas of the paper [Physics-Informed Neural Networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021999118307125) by M.Raissi et al. as a self-contained homework set with solutions.

We implemented data-driven solution of partial differential equations with a demo of solving the Schrodinger Equation.
